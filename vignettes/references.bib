    abstract = "{The snoRNA-LBME-db is a dedicated database containing human C/D box and H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs are part of ribonucleoparticles that guide 2′-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridilation, respectively, of selected residues of 28S, 18S or 5.8S rRNAs or of the spliceosomal U6 RNA. Similarly, scaRNAs guide modifications of the spliceosomal RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12) and are often composed of both C/D box and H/ACA box domains. However, some snoRNAs do not function as modification guide RNAs, but rather as RNA chaperones during the maturation of pre-rRNA. The database was built by a compilation of the literature, and comprises human sno/scaRNAs that were experimentally verified, as well as the human orthologs of snoRNAs that were cloned in other vertebrate species, and some snoRNAs that are predicted by bioinformatics search in loci submitted to genomic imprinting, but have not all been experimentally verified. For each entry, the database identifies the modified nucleotide(s) in the target RNA(s), indicates the corresponding predicted base pairing, gives a few pertinent references and provides a link to the position of the sno/scaRNA on the UCSC Genome Browser. The ‘Find guide RNA’ function allows one to find the sno/scaRNAs predicted to guide the modification of a particular nucleotide in the rRNA and spliceosomal RNA sequences. The ‘Browse’ function allows one to download the sequences of selected sno/scaRNAs in the FASTA format. The database is available online at http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/. It can also be accessed from the human UCSC Genome Browser via the sno/miRNA track.}",

 abstract = {Ribose methylations are the most abundant chemical modifications of ribosomal RNA and are critical for ribosome assembly and fidelity of translation. Many aspects of ribose methylations have been difficult to study due to lack of efficient mapping methods. Here, we present a sequencing-based method (RiboMeth-seq) and its application to yeast ribosomes, presently the best-studied eukaryotic model system. We demonstrate detection of the known as well as new modifications, reveal partial modifications and unexpected communication between modification events, and determine the order of modification at several sites during ribosome biogenesis. Surprisingly, the method also provides information on a subset of other modifications. Hence, RiboMeth-seq enables a detailed evaluation of the importance of RNA modifications in the cells most sophisticated molecular machine. RiboMeth-seq can be adapted to other RNA classes, for example, mRNA, to reveal new biology involving RNA modifications.},

@article{Marchand.2017,
 abstract = {Detection of RNA modifications in native RNAs is a tedious and laborious task, since the global level of these residues is low and most of the suitable physico-chemical methods require purification of the RNA of interest almost to homogeneity. To overcome these limitations, methods based on RT-driven primer extension have been developed and successfully used, sometimes in combination with a specific chemical treatment. Nowadays, some of these approaches have been coupled to high-throughput sequencing technologies, allowing the access to transcriptome-wide data. RNA 2'-O-methylation is one of the ubiquitous nucleotide modifications found in many RNA types from bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Here, we describe a reliable and optimized protocol based on alkaline fragmentation of total RNA coupled to a commonly used ligation approach followed by Illumina sequencing. We describe the methodology for detection and relative quantification of 2'-O-methylations with a high sensitivity and reproducibility even with a limited amount of starting material (1 ng of total RNA). Altogether this technique unlocks a technological barrier since it will be applicable for routine parallel treatment of biological and clinical samples to decipher the functions of 2'-O-methylations in pathologies.},

Despite important advances in the field during the last 10 years, this task is still extremely laborious and time-consuming, even when high-throughput analytical approaches are employed. Moreover, only a very limited subset of RNA modifications can be detected and only rarely be quantified by these powerful techniques. In the past, we developed and successfully applied alkaline fragmentation-based RiboMethSeq approach for mapping and precise quantification of multiple 2{\textasciiacutex}-O-methylation residues in ribosomal RNA.
